# What is TraderWatch?


The idea is to create a lightweight, simple and ultra flexible watch. The goal is to have a watch that is showing the actual time and our beloved Stocks/Cryptocurrencies/ExchangeRates.

The API used is yahoo finance so, it is not guaranteed tha it would work forever. But it is anyway really easy to fix.

The Repo with the code can be found here: [TraderWatchRepo](https://github.com/PlasticSkunkWorks/TraderWatch).
